# Diwali Sales Analysis
## Project Overview
The Diwali Sales Analysis project focuses on analyzing sales data during the Diwali festival to gain insights into customer behavior, improve customer experience, and optimize sales strategies. By performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques, we aim to identify patterns and trends in the data to make informed decisions.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains sales data during the Diwali festival, including details such as customer demographics, product categories, and sales quantities. It provides a comprehensive view of customer preferences and sales performance.
## Project Goals
### The main objectives of this analysis are as follows:
1. Identify Potential Customers: Analyze customer demographics, including states, occupations, gender, and age groups, to identify potential customers. This information will help in targeting specific customer segments and tailoring marketing strategies to improve customer experience.
2. Identify Most Selling Product Categories and Products: Determine the product categories and specific products that have the highest sales during the Diwali festival. This insight will assist in planning inventory, ensuring product availability, and meeting customer demands.
## Project Structure
### 1. Problem Statement
Define the problem and objectives of the analysis: understanding customer behavior, identifying sales trends, and evaluating product performance.
### 2. Analysis Steps
The analysis is performed in several steps.Each aimed at understanding different aspects of the data:
#### Data Importing 
Libraries Import: Import necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
#### Data Loading: Load the diwali sales dataset.
- Load the dataset using Pandas. 
- Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
#### Data Cleaning and Manipulation:
handle missing values, Drop irrelevant columns and remove duplicates if any, and perform necessary data transformation. This step ensures the data is in suitable format for analysis. 
### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
